Hi, I'm Andr√©s 

I'm been programming in some capacity for close to ten years now.

In addition to computers. I am also very interested in math and design, in particular the problem of faithfully distilling and communicating complicated ideas.

Some of the earliest code I wrote was a [TUI in ruby](https://rubygems.org/gems/richter_catalogue) for browsing [Gerhard Richter's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerhard_Richter) catalogue.

I am still bewildered for why or how it was downloaded over 5000 times.

More recently

I have used a [convolution](https://github.com/aduarterengifo/virtual-infinite-grid/blob/main/src/m-n-k/win-check-conv-2.ts) to check for the winner of a game of tic-tac-toe.

I have ported an [interpreter](https://github.com/aduarterengifo/ts-monkey) from a book to typescript and I'm working on expanding it to add first-class support for symbolic differentiation.

The interpreter kicked off an heavy interest in programming languages which has me reading books about type theory and logic.
